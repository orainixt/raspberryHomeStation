# raspberryHomeStation
This is the code for my own raspberry station

# How it works 
- I'm currently trying to "copy" a google station, with informations that I think are usefull for my day 
- It's in python (I'm using a raspbery) 
- The sources files are in [src]
- The data files are in [data] 

## State of Development 
- For the moment, I only coded the main files, nothing is "pretty"
